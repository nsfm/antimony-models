This repo contains a collection of parametric models I designed using [Antimony](https://github.com/mkeeter/antimony).

Check out [my Antimony fork](https://github.com/nsfm/antimony) - it adds a few handy nodes and an autosave feature.

### Offerings

A few of the models come with descriptions and screenshots:

- [3D printer dial indicator mount](./dial_indicator_mount)
- [Air layering pod](./air_layerer)
- [Darkfield Filter](./darkfield_filter)
- [Dovetailed end table](./dovetailed_end_table)
- [Knockoff match striker](./match_striker)
- [Misting nozzle holder](./mister_holder)
- [Sphere candle holder](./sphere_candle_holder)

### Contributing

- There are a ton of small quality-of-life changes I'd love to see added to Antimony if you're up for improving the tool.
- I'd be super interested in a tool to quickly export screenshots of models and their graphs to make setting up a gallery easier.
- The STL exports from Antimony are very poorly optimized - the files are huge. If you can suggest a convenient post-processing workflow, I'd be overjoyed.
- If you have suggestions for optimizing or improving any of the models, feel free to open a PR! My technique has been changing over time and I'd love to see new approaches.
