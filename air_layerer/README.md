# Magnetic moss holder for air layering

Air layering is a technique that involves binding moss or some other rootable substrate to a plant, in order to encourage the development of aerial roots. Developing aerial roots on a plant node improves the likelihood of success during propagation by cutting.

To use this model, you must print two copies. Each side takes four small neodymium magnets - take care to align them properly, with opposite poles facing out on each half.

Pack each half with spaghnum moss, and clip it to the plant. Keep moist.
